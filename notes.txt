Access token and Refresh token -> Both are kind of same , refresh token is longed lived

1. Till we have Access token , we can access (authorised) any feature which require authorisation.

-> Refresh token : we save in db and also send to the user : 

-> when the access token expires , hit a url if your refresh token and refresh token in the db is same , you are authorised
and from the server you get a new access token 


::: FRONT END
-> if we have a request (not authorised)

we can tell user to go on a route to refresh access token
(get new token)
